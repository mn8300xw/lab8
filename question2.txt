2. Property ... was accessed during render but is not defined on instance.  5 points
What does this Vue warning message mean? Can you safely ignore it? What causes it,
and how do you fix it?  Write an answer in your own words.

Vue warning indicates that there is no initial definition for the variable "total".
It is trying to access a variable that is empty, so there is nothing to access.
The best way to solve this is to assign an empty ref. This will give it a placeholder.
